abstract: Ionic polymer-metal composites (IPMCs) have been studied extensively in the field of actuation and sensing and have shown to have very promising sensing applications. In this study, we have utilized rectangular IPMC sensors to explore a range of measurable flow rates and the feasibility of using IPMCs as underwater sensors in a cantilever form, The sensor was subjected to flow speeds ranging from 16 to 235 mm/s.
