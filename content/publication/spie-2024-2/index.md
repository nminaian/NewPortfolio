abstract: This study presents a biomimetic approach for developing scalable 3D printable models of a California sea lion pelvis using DICOM standard images derived from computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The images were processed using Simpleware ScanIP software to create accurate and detailed representations of the targeted anatomy. The resulting models were then modified and optimized for 3D printing of a scalable biostructure. The California sea lion that serves as the anatomical template for this study, requires a specific blood extraction location near the caudal region of the sea lionâ€™s pelvis. The developed 3D printable models offer several advantages. They enable repeated practice sessions, allowing trainees to gain confidence and refine their technique in a controlled environment. Moreover, the use of 3D printing technology ensures accessibility and affordability, making it suitable for a wide range of educational institutions and veterinary clinics. The motivation behind this research is to provide a realistic and cost-effective alternative to traditional training methods for veterinary blood collection, while also potentially utilizing these derived models for future underwater platform design for smart materials as the caudal region of the California sea lion additionally serves as essential support, enabling efficient swimming and maneuverability in water. The abstract serves as a precursor to a comprehensive study, detailing the development process, validation, and evaluation of the 3D printable models. The proposed work has the potential to enhance veterinary education and blood extraction training, ultimately improving the quality of care provided to animal patients.
