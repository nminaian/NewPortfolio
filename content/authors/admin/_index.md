Nazanin Minaian is a dedicated Ph.D. candidate at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV), working in the Active Materials and Smart Living (AMSL) lab under the guidance of Professor Kwang J. Kim. Her research focuses on electroactive polymers (EAPs) and their practical applications in dynamic environments. Drawing inspiration from aquatic sensory organs, she has developed innovative designs for flow sensing and energy harvesting, motivated by the potential to integrate natural principles with cutting-edge technology for real-world applications, including underwater hydrofoils and renewable energy systems. Her dissertation, titled “Bio-Inspired Electroactive Polymer Sensors for Surface and Canal Flow Sensing in Dynamic Environments,” explores these topics through three major case studies.

In addition to her research, Nazanin teaches ME 453: Mechanical Vibrations, where she emphasizes student engagement. Her teaching style reflects her commitment to helping students develop problem-solving skills in real-world contexts, using methods that encourage exploration and deep understanding. Nazanin's academic endeavors have extended across borders, as she had the privilege of collaborating with international researchers on the topic of soft robotics, further enriching her knowledge and expertise in the field. With a background as an Iranian-American woman in engineering, she blends cultural mindfulness with scientific rigor, bringing a unique and thoughtful perspective to her work.
