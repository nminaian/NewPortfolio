title: 'DICOM-based Models and 3D Printing for Underwater Platforms'
summary: Utilizing acquired DICOM images to create CAD models designed for additive manufacturing (employing various software suites such as Simpleware ScanIP and Autodesk Fusion 360). This project is an ongoing effort in gaining insight into new working mechanisms that will aid in underwater vehicle or platform design – largely inspired by biological components. Currently the lead on this project to create a scalable Sea Lion pelvis model that can be used for training volunteers on blood extraction. Additionally mentored two undergraduate students as a technical advisor who utilized this method for their university capstone project.

## Project Summary

Utilizing acquired DICOM images to create CAD models designed to be additively manufactured (utilizing various software suites such as Simpleware ScanIP and Autodesk ReMake). This project is an ongoing effort in gaining insight into new working mechanisms that will aid in underwater vehicle or platform design – largely inspired by biological components. Currently the lead on this project and working with the National Marine Mammal Foundation to create a scalable Sea Lion pelvis model that can be used for training volunteers on blood extraction. Additionally mentored two undergraduate students as a technical advisor who utilized this method for their university capstone project.
