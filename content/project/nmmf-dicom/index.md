title: 'DICOM-based Models and 3D Printing Collaboration with the National Marine Mammal Foundation (NMMF)'
summary: Utilizing acquired DICOM images to create CAD models designed to be additively manufactured (utilizing various software suites such as Simpleware ScanIP and Autodesk ReMake). This project is an ongoing effort in gaining insight into new working mechanisms that will aid in underwater vehicle or platform design â€“ largely inspired by biological components. Currently the lead on this project and working with the National Marine Mammal Foundation to create a scalable Sea Lion pelvis model that can be used for training volunteers on blood extraction. Mentoring two undergraduate students as a technical advisor who are utilizing this method for their university capstone project.
